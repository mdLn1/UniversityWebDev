### Environment Setup instructions

1. Install git => [link](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

2. Install node and  npm => [link](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

   Select LTS and choose your Operating System, download and install accordingly

   **npm comes together with node, once installed I recommend using node version 10.0.0 and npm version 5.6.0**
   
   If you want to install the version mentioned above you need to do the following:
   
   npm install -g node@10.0.0
   
   npm install -g npm@5.6.0
   
   **-g means that everything is installed globally**
   
3. Create a folder then go inside the folder location through a terminal (Command Prompt for windows)

4. Type in the console: 

   git clone https://github.com/mdLn1/UniversityWebDev/
   
5. Once everything is downloaded run:

   **npm install** then **npm clientinstall**
