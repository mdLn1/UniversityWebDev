### Environment Setup instructions

1. Install git => [link](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

2. Install node and  npm => [link] (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
   **npm comes together with node, once installed I recommend using node version 10.0.0 and npm version 5.6.0**
   If you want to install the version mentioned above you need to do the following:
   
   ...
   npm install -g node@10.0.0
   npm install -g npm@5.6.0
   ...
   
   **-g means that everything is installed globally**
   
3. Create a folder and go to its location in a terminal (Command Prompt for windows)

4. Type in the console: 
'''
   git clone https://github.com/mdLn1/UniversityWebDev/
'''
